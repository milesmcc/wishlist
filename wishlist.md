1. A browser plug-in that blocks external requests from service workers
2. A website where you can automatically provide 'proof-of-life'â€”for example, if you're in a country with lots of violence, you can do a daily check in to assure everyone you're OK. If you don't check in, the site would automatically notify the police/family+friends/whoever you configure. Could also be useful as a canary mechanism.
